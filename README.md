About Melody Timer:

Melody Timer was inspired by school bells. It plays calm, mood-based music while you work and gives you break time in between just like class and recess. It helps you stay focused and take breaks without needing to think about it.


How Melody Timer works:

-Add focused tasks with your preferred music mood
-Get automatic breaks between tasks
-Stay on track with a simple and cozy interface
